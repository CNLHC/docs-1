Read replicas enable you to distribute workloads across database replicas for high-traffic workloads. The [`@prisma/extension-read-replicas`](https://github.com/prisma/extension-read-replicas) extension adds read replication support to Prisma Client.

The read replicas extension supports Prisma versions 5.2.0 and higher.

## Setup the read replicas extension

Install the extension:

```terminal
npm install @prisma/extension-read-replicas
```

Initialize the extension by extending your Prisma Client instance and pointing it to a database replica:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
import { readReplicas } from '@prisma/extension-read-replicas'

const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(
  readReplicas({
    url: process.env.DATABASE_URL_REPLICA,
  })
)

// Query is run against the database replica
await prisma.post.findMany()

// Query is run against the primary database
await prisma.post.create({ 
  data: {/** */},
})
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

With the above setup, all read operations, e.g. `findMany`, will be executed against the database replica. All write queries, e.g. `create` and `update`, and `$transaction` queries will be executed against your primary database.

<Admonition type="warning">

If you're using Prisma versions 5.1.0 or lower, the [result extensions](/concepts/components/prisma-client/client-extensions/result) will not work when using the read replicas extension.

</Admonition>

## Configure multiple database replicas

The `url` property also accepts an array of values, i.e. an array of all your database replicas you would like to configure:

```ts
const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(
  readReplicas({
    url: [
      process.env.DATABASE_URL_REPLICA_1,
      process.env.DATABASE_URL_REPLICA_2,
    ],
  })
)
```

If you have more than one read replica configured, a database replica will be randomly selected to execute your query.

## Executing read operations against your primary database

You can use the `$primary()` method to explicitly execute a read operation against your primary database:

```ts
const posts = await prisma.$primary().post.findMany()
```

## Executing operations against a database replica

You can use the `$replica()` method to explicitly execute your query against a replica instead of your primary database:

```ts
const result = await prisma.$replica().$queryRaw`SELECT ...`
```
