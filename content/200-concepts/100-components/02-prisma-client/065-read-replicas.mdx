<TopBlock>

You can add read replication in your application using the [`@prisma/extension-read-replicas`] Prisma Client extension.

</TopBlock>

Install the extension in your project:

```terminal
npm install @prisma/extension-read-replicas
```

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client'
import { readReplicas } from '@prisma/extension-read-replicas'

const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(
  readReplicas({
    url: process.env.DATABASE_URL_REPLICA,
  })
)
```

```ts
const prisma = new PrismaClient().$extends(
  readReplicas({
    url: [
      process.env.DATABASE_URL_REPLICA_1,
      process.env.DATABASE_URL_REPLICA_2,
    ],
  })
)
```

You can use the `$primary()` method to execute queries through against your primary database instance:

```ts
const posts = await prisma.$primary().post.findMany()
```

You can use the `$replica()` method to explicitly execute your query against a replica instead of your primary database:

```ts
const result = await prisma.$replica().$queryRaw`SELECT ...`
```
